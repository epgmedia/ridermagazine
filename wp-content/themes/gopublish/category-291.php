<h1 style=\"font-weight:bold\">Sidecar + Scooter + Trike Motorcycles</h1>

<p>Sidecar + Scooter + Trike Motorcycles is a catch&#8211;all category that, according to guides, includes machines that have styling, controls and seating positions like those found on motorcycles, but are different in important ways. Reviews of the Sidecars category include motorcycles with an affixed sidecar rig, also known as a &#8220;sidehack,&#8221; that adds a third wheel and a car that can be used to carry a passenger or cargo. Scooters have a step&#8211;through design that offers a chair&#8211;like seating position with the rider&#8217;s knees close together, as well as a twist&#8211;and&#8211;go transmission (usually a CVT) that doesn&#8217;t require a rider to change gears manually. Trikes are typically conversions&#8211;motorcycles with the rear wheel replaced by an axle and two car&#8211;like wheels/tires.</p>

<h2><strong>Sidecar + Scooter + Trike Motorcycles, Who Uses Them?</strong></h2>

<p>Sidecars, scooters and trikes appeal to very different riders. Road tests emphasize the fact that motorcycles with sidecars, which are considered quirky by anyone who doesn&#8217;t own one&#8211;part of the appeal&#8211;handle very differently than two&#8211;wheeled, single&#8211;track (one wheel in front of the other) motorcycles because they don&#8217;t lean when going around corners and curves, and thus require special riding skills. Scooters typically have small&#8211;displacement engines (49cc to 650cc) and are small and lightweight, making them perfect for riding around town. Because you don&#8217;t have to shift gears using a manual clutch and shift lever, anyone who knows how to ride a bicycle can operate a scooter. Like sidecars, trikes don&#8217;t lean when they go around corners, which gives riders a greater sense of stability and safety during road tests. Reviews indicate that many trike riders also appreciate not having to raise the machine off a sidestand, not having to put their feet down at stops, and not being concerned about tipping over, a common concern regarding motorcycles.</p>

<h2><strong>Sidecar + Scooter + Trike Motorcycle Standouts</strong></h2>

<p>Motorcycle guides discuss the fact that sidecars are quite rare these days, and the only major manufacturer of sidecar&#8211;equipped motorcycles is Ural, a Russian manufacturer. With old&#8211;school, utilitarian styling, Ural offers several models, from the entry&#8211;level Ural T with single&#8211;wheel drive to the military&#8211;spec Ural Gear&#8211;Up with two&#8211;wheel drive. Independent manufacturers such as Hannigan Motorsports, based in Kentucky, build sidecars for a variety of touring, sport&#8211;touring and dual&#8211;sport motorcycles. Scooters are manufactured by many companies, including Aprilia, Honda, Kymco, Piaggio, Suzuki, Vespa, Yamaha, and others. Most trikes are sold as conversions, but some motorcycle reviews discuss motorbikes that are mass&#8211;produced, such as the Harley&#8211;Davidson Tri&#8211;Glide and the Can&#8211;Am Spyder, a unique roadster with two wheels in front. Trike conversions are offered for many cruisers, touring bikes and scooters by companies such as Hannigan Motorsports, Motor Trike, Danson, Tow&#8211;Pac and Lehman.</p>

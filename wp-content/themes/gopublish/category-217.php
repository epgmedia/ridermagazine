                    Retro + Vintage Motorcycle reviews and road tests include old (vintage)
                    motorcycles, such as those featured in Clement Salvadori&#8217;s
                    <em>Retrospective</em> column each month, as well as motorcycles styled
                    to look like those that rolled off the assembly line decades ago (retro).
                    Cruisers can be considered retro due to their styling, but they&#8217;re
                    a more natural fit in the Cruiser + Touring Motorcycles category.

            <h2><strong>Retro + Vintage Motorcycles, Who Uses Them?</strong></h2>

            <p>
                According to reviews Retro + Vintage Motorcycles appeal to older riders
                who feel nostalgic for the motorbikes they longed for when they were
                young, as well as to younger riders who appreciate styling and technology
                from years past. Rare and exceptional vintage motorcycles have become
                quite popular among collectors, with auctions fetching record prices year
                after year. With recent economic times requiring folks to do more with
                less, many motorcyclists have pulled dusty old bikes out of their garage
                and restored them to working order. Others who want the look of a vintage
                motorcycle but not the spongy brakes, dodgy tires and clapped&#8211;out
                suspension buy modern&#8211;built, retro&#8211;styled motorcycles.

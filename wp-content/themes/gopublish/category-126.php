                <p>
                    Honda, the biggest of the Japanese Big Four, began manufacturing
                    motorcycles in 1955. Honda motorcycle road tests reflect the
                    company's history as the world's largest manufacturer of both
                    motorcycles and internal combustion engines by volume. Honda's
                    Super Cub, having been in continuous production since 1958 and
                    surpassing 60 million units in 2008, is the world's most produced
                    motor vehicle. The Super Cub's U.S. advertising campaign,
                    &quot;You meet the nicest people on a Honda,&quot; had a positive,
                    enduring impact on Honda motorcycles, their image, and American
                    attitudes about motorcycling.

            <h2><strong>Honda Motorcycles, Who Uses Them? </strong></h2>

            <p>
                Honda offers a full range of motorcycles, from cruisers, sport
                tourers, sportbikes and the iconic Gold Wing luxury tourer to
                dirt bikes, dual-sports and scooters, as well as ATVs, side-by-sides
                and personal watercraft.

                mark 1969 as the year the Honda CB750 introduced the transverse, overhead
                camshaft, in-line four cylinder engine that became the dominant configuration
                among high-performance motorcycles, and became the first widely produced
                motorcycle to feature a front disc brake. The 1974 Honda Gold Wing GL1000
                featured a reliable, torquey, smooth-running flat-four engine that was
                ideal for long-distance touring; over its nearly 40-year history of Honda
                motorcycle road tests, the Gold Wing became the standard by which all other
                luxury-touring motorcycles were measured. In the early 1980s, Honda's VF/VFR
                line of V4 powered motorcycles launched the sportbike category, bringing
                'race replica' styling, suspension and performance to street-legal motorcycles.
                The Honda VFR750 went on to become one of the most refined and revered
                sport-touring motorcycles ever made.

                In Honda motorcycle reviews, the VFR1200F was <em>Rider's</em> 2010 Motorcycle
                of the Year because of its powerful, MotoGP-inspired V4 engine, optional
                dual-clutch transmission (a first on a motorcycle) and exquisite fit and
                finish, elevating Honda's iconic VFR to an even higher level of sophistication.

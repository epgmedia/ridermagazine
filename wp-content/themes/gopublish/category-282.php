<h1 style=\"font-weight:bold\">Sport Standard + Standard Motorcycles</h1>

<p>Sport Standard + Standard Motorcycles are, like cruisers, bikes that are stripped bare with no bodywork, which is why they are sometimes referred to as &#8220;naked&#8221; bikes, though included in reviews and road tests of this category are some bikes with small fairings and windshields. But unlike cruisers, sport standards and standards have a more upright riding position and styling that can range from basic to sporty. Motorcycle guides state that they&#8217;re lighter, have more cornering clearance and are more performance oriented than cruisers. The term &#8220;standard&#8221; is used because they are versatile, general purpose motorbikes. Included in this category are &#8220;streetfighters,&#8221; tough&#8211;looking street bikes that are essentially sportbikes without bodywork. </p>

<h2><strong>Sport Standard + Standard Motorcycles, Who Uses Them?</strong></h2>

<p>Motorcycle guides discuss the fact that Sport Standard + Standard Motorcycles, though popular in the 1970s and 1980s (the term Universal Japanese Motorcycle, or UJM, was coined back then because all four major Japanese manufacturers&#8211;Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki and Yamaha&#8211;offered seemingly interchangeable motorcycles with in&#8211;line four engines, similar chassis and conventional styling), since the 1990s sport standards and standard motorbikes have been overshadowed by more specialized motorcycles: sport tourers, tourers, sportbikes, dual&#8211;sports, etc. Sport standards and standard motorcycles are popular in road tests among riders who want a no&#8211;nonsense motorcycle, one that performs well but isn&#8217;t limited by excessive weight and bodywork. On the other hand, because of their basic nature, many owners add accessories to enhance the performance, touring capability or other aspect of their motorcycle.</p>

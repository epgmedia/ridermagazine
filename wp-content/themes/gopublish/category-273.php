                <p>
                    Dual&#8211;Sport + Adventure Motorcycles are street&#8211;legal
                    motorcycles that are designed for use both on&#8211; and off&#8211;road
                    (the &#8220;dual&#8221; in dual&#8211;sport or dual&#8211;purpose).
                    Dual&#8211;sport motorcycle guides discuss the fact that these are
                    typically single&#8211;cylinder motorbikes with engine displacements
                    ranging from 250cc to 650cc. Adventure motorcycles, also known as adventurer
                    tourers or travel enduros, have larger, multi&#8211;cylinder engines
                    (650cc and up) and are often equipped for long&#8211;distance travel with
                    windshields, comfortable seats, saddlebags or side cases. Due to the rigors
                    of off&#8211;road use, dual&#8211;sport and adventure motorcycles often
                    have durable bodywork and protective elements such as hand guards, engine
                    guards and skid plates &#8211; something to look for when reading
                    Dual&#8211;Sport + Adventure Motorcycle reviews. Their tires often have a
                    large&#8211;block tread pattern that provide grip on pavement and in dirt or
                    gravel; those ridden almost exclusively off&#8211;road usually run knobby
                    tires like those found on dirt bikes.

            <h2><strong>Dual&#8211;Sport + Adventure Motorcycles, Who Uses Them?</strong></h2>

            <p>
                Dual&#8211;Sport + Adventure Motorcycles are increasingly popular because
                of their versatility, as emphasized by road tests on these motorbikes.
                According to data from the Motorcycle Industry Council, they accounted for
                6.3% of all motorcycle unit sales in 2012. They are street&#8211;legal and
                designed to be ridden both on&#8211; and off&#8211;road, allowing riders
                to use one motorcycle for almost all types of riding. Like Swiss Army knives
                and Jeeps, dual&#8211;sport and adventure motorcycles are tough and ready
                for anything. They typically have large&#8211;diameter front wheels (19&#8211;
                or 21&#8211;inch) that easily roll over obstacles, long&#8211;travel suspension
                that soaks up large bumps, and heavy&#8211;duty frames and components. Because
                of their large front wheels and long&#8211;travel suspension, they often have
                tall seat heights (32 inches and up) that can make them impractical for smaller
                or shorter riders. Reviews frequently discuss the features that Dual&#8211;sport
                and adventure riders are known for, such as adding &#8220;farkles,&#8221;
                accessories that combine &#8220;function&#8221; and &#8220;sparkle,&#8221;
                like auxiliary lights, bolt&#8211;on protective pieces and GPS navigation units,
                to their bikes.

            <h2><strong>Dual&#8211;Sport + Adventure Motorcycle Standouts</strong></h2>

            <p>
                The Kawasaki KLR650, a 650cc single&#8211;cylinder dual&#8211;sport motorcycle
                that has been in production since 1987 with remarkably few changes, has been
                the top&#8211;selling dual&#8211;sport motorcycle for many years due to its
                performance in road tests, reliability and low sticker price. Other popular
                dual&#8211;sport motorcycles are the Honda XR650L and CRF250L, Kawasaki KLX250S,
                KTM 690 Enduro R, Suzuki DR650 and DR&#8211;Z400S, and Yamaha WR250R.
                BMW invented the adventure touring segment with its 1980 R80G/S, where G/S
                stands for <em>Gel&auml;nde/Strasse</em> (German for off&#8211;road/road).
                Today its R 1200 GS carries on that tradition and is one of the most popular
                adventure touring motorcycles, along with other BMWs such as the F 800 GS and
                G 650 GS. Other popular adventure motorcycles discussed in guides include the
                Ducati Multistrada 1200, KTM 1190 Adventure, Suzuki V&#8211;Strom 650/1000,
                Triumph Tiger 800/XC and Tiger Explorer, and Yamaha Super T&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;.

<h2><strong>Moto Guzzi Motorcycle Standouts</strong></h2>
<p>
The Moto Guzzi Grand Prix V8, introduced in 1955, was the first 500cc racing motorcycle fitted with a V8 engine utilizing dual overhead camshafts. It had two valves per cylinder, an oversquare bore/stroke (44.0 x 40.5 mm), and output around 80 horsepower at 12,000 rpm. In 1971, Moto Guzzi motorcycle reviews lauded the 750 V7 Sport, designed as the first 5-speed, 440-pound, 120-mph production motorcycle. A year later, Moto Guzzi introduced the California cruiser models, based on the model sold to the Los Angeles Police Department. The California remained popular in road tests and reviews throughout the 1980s and 1990s and remains in the U.S. Moto Guzzi range as the all-new California 1400. The iconic 850 Le Mans, a caf&eacute; racer, was released in 1976 and is still considered one of the most sought after of all Guzzis. The GT Norge was made famous for its 4,000-mile test ride in 1928 that proved its suspension prototype: the world's first swingarm suspension. In 2005, the Norge 1200 was introduced by retracing the 1928 ride. In 2008, Moto Guzzi added the Stelvio 1200, an adventure tourer named after the famous Stelvio Pass in the Italian Alps.

<p>
The Can-Am motorcycle brand began in the 1970s, creating off-road dirt bikes and taking home the top three places in the International Six Days Enduro. Can-Am motorbikes also swept the 1974 AMA 250cc National Motocross Championship. Despite its success in racing, Can-Am's primary holding company, Bombardier Recreational Products (BRP), shifted focus away from the motorcycle market. In 2006, BRP reintroduced the Can-Am brand with an all-new ATV line. Then, in 2007, the Can-Am brand was also used to introduce the Can-Am Spyder, a new three-wheeled roadster.

<h2><strong>Can-Am Motorcycles, Who Uses Them?</strong></h2>
<p>Today, Can-Am reviews focus on the three-wheeled Spyder line for street use, as well as several ATVs and side-by-side vehicles like the Commander and Outlander for off-road use.</p>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Can-Am Motorcycle Standouts</strong></h2>
<p>
The Can-Am Roadster has a unique Y-shaped footprint with two wheels up front to give it more stability and control, making it easy for just about anyone to ride. Can-Am motorcycle road tests on the Spyder line include the Spyder RT (luxury touring), ST (sport touring) and RS (sport). All have anti-lock brakes, stability control and an optional semi-automatic transmission.

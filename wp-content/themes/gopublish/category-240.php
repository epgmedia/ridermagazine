                    Suzuki Motor Corporation is a Japanese manufacturer of motorcycles,
                    ATVs, automobiles and 4x4 vehicles, marine engines, wheelchairs and
                    small internal combustion engines. Suzuki motorcycle road tests and
                    guides praise the company&#8217;s cruisers (Boulevard M109R,
                    Boulevard C50T and others), sportbikes (Hayabusa, GSX-R1000,
                    GSX1250FA and others), adventure tourers (V-Strom 650/1000),
                    ual-sports (DR650SE, DR-Z400S) and dirt bikes (RM-Z450, DR-Z125 and
                    others). Outstanding Suzuki motorcycle reviews led to the brand
                    winning Rider&#8217;s Motorcycle of the Year in 2002 with the V-Strom
                    1000.

                Suzuki introduced the first GSX-R750 sportbike in 1985, and it
                was one of the first motorcycles to offer the power, performance
                and lightweight of a racing motorcycle to consumers. In 2002,
                Suzuki introduced the DL1000 V-Strom, an adventure touring motorcycle
                that combined power, comfort, ruggedness and load capacity into a
                go-anywhere package. Due to excellent performance in Suzuki motorcycle
                reviews and road tests, V-Stroms &#8211; along with the DL650 variant
                introduced in 2004 &#8211; have proven to be very popular among
                touring riders.

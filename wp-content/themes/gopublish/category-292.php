<p>
Yamaha created Star Motorcycles in 1994 as a standalone brand for its line of cruiser motorcycles in the U.S. market. In 2006, the motorbike brand was expanded to being its own company, although the brand is operated out of the Yamaha Motor Corporation offices in Cypress, California, and Yamaha still handles production and distribution. All Star motorcycles are designed in the United States.

<h2><strong>Star Motorcycles, Who Uses Them?</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Star Motorcycle Standouts</strong></h2>
<p>
Star Motorcycle reviews address a mix of cruiser models, including the Royal Star Venture S luxury tourer, Stratoliner and Roadliner Big Twins, Road Star and V Star lines (ranging from 250cc to 1,670cc), its Stryker and Raider choppers and Vmax power cruiser. In 2012, Star motorcycle road tests began on the Star Custom Line (SCL), a limited-production line of factory custom motorcycles, the first of which was the SCL Raider.

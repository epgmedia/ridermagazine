<h1 style=\"font-weight:bold\">Sport + Sport Touring Motorcycles</h1>

<p>Motorcyles guides discussing Sport + Sport Touring Motorcycles include discussion of sportbikes that resemble road race bikes with turn signals and license plates, and motorcycles that blend the performance of sportbikes with the wind protection, comfort and luggage capacity of touring bikes. Sportbikes, some of which are homologated for racing and others that offer the go&#8211;fast look but are designed exclusively for street riding, cover a broad range of engine sizes (from the 150cc Kymco Quannon 150 to the 1,441cc Kawasaki Ninja ZX&#8211;14R), numbers of cylinders (singles, twins, triples and fours) and configurations (parallel twin, V&#8211;twin, V4, in&#8211;line triple or four), but according to reviews and road tests, most have performance oriented engines and components, aerodynamic bodywork and aggressive riding positions. Because sport&#8211;touring motorbikes are a hybrid category, guides also cover a broad range of engine sizes and types, but reviews state that they tend to have comfortable riding positions, good wind protection thanks to a windshield and fairing, standard luggage (saddlebags, perhaps a trunk) and touring amenities such as cruise control, ABS, audio systems and more.</p>

				<h2><strong>Sport + Sport Touring Motorcycles, Who Uses Them?</strong></h2>

				<p>Road tests have found that Sport + Sport Touring Motorcycles appeal to a
				   wide range of riders, including men and women of all ages, but what unites
				   them is a love of performance. Sportbikes and sport tourers are designed to
				   go fast, be it on the track, in the canyons, or down an interstate highway.
				   Sportbike riders are usually willing to sacrifice some comfort in exchange
				   for light weight and sporty handling, which may involve firm suspension, low
				   handlebars and high, tucked&#8211;back footpegs. Motorcycle reviews indicate
				   that Sport&#8211;touring riders don&#8217;t want to concede too much
				   performance, but they&#8217;ll accept a heavier motorcycle that offers more
				   comfort, wind protection, luggage capacity and features that make life
				   easier when you spend long hours in the saddle.</p>
